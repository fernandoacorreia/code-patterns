# Dynamic programming (DP)

Used for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and storing their solutions to
avoid repetitive work.

Useful for problems with overlapping subproblems, and optimal substructure problems; problems where you need to maximize
or minimize a certain value; count the number of ways to achieve a certain goal.

Common DP patterns:
- Fibonacci numbers - https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/solutions/5752538/easy-dp-recursion-memoization/
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest common subsequence
- Longest increasing subsequence
- Subset sum
- Matrix chain multiplication

Problems:
- 70. Climbing stairs
- 300. Longest increasing subsequence
- 322. Coin change
- 416. Partition equal subset sum
- 1143. Longest common subsequence
- 312. Burst baloons
