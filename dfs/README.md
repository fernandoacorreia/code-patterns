# Dept-first search (DFS)

Explore all paths or branches in graphs or trees.

Problems:
- Finding a path between two nodes.
- Checking if a graph contains a cycle.
- Find a topological order in a direct-acyclic graph (DAG).
- Counting the number of connected components in a graph.

Can be implemented recursively or iteratively (using a stack).
