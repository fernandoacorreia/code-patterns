# Binary tree traversal

Binaries trees are about traversing them in a specific order.

Popular ways to traverse a binary tree:

- PreOrder (retrieve values in sorted order): root -> left -> right
- InOrder (serialization): left -> root -> right
- PostOrder (process child nodes before parent): left -> right -> root
- LevelOrder (explore all nodes at the current level before moving to the next): level by level (deque)
