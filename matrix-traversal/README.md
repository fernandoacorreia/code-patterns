# Matrix traversal

Can be seen as a graph problem.

A matrix is usually a 2D array where nodes are the cells from where you can reach to adjacent cells horizontally,
vertically or diagonally.

Graph algorithms like DFS and BFS can be used to solve matrix related problems.

- Finding the shortest path in a grid.

## Binary count problem:

You're given a 2D binary grid where 1 is land and 0 is water.
You need to return the number of island.
An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

## Problems

- 733. Flood Fill
- 200. Number of Islands
- 130. Surrounder Regions
