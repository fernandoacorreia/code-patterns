# Breadth-first search (BFS)

Explores nodes level by level in a tree or a graph.

Problems:
- Finding the shortest path between two nodes.
- Printing all nodes of a tree level by level.
- Finding all connected components in a graph.
- Finding the shortest transformation sequence from one word to another.

Can be implemented using a queue.

- Add the starting node to the queue.
- Set up a visited set.
- Continue while the queue is not empty.
- Dequeue a node and process it.
- Enqueue unsivited neighbors.

Problems:
- 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
